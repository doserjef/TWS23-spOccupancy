## Course description

We will present an accessible overview of single-species, multi-species, and integrated spatially-explicit occupancy modeling with a focus on implementing these models using the spOccupancy R package. Emphasis will be placed on practical software tools rather than statistical details. Basic proficiency in R and generalized linear models is a prerequesite.

********
## Prior to the workshop getting started

This workshop offers lecture, discussion, and hands-on exercises . We encourage you to work along with us on the exercises. To participate fully in the exercises, you'll need a recent version of R ($\geqslant$ 4.2). 

### Installing *spOccupancy*

The course will focus on using the `spOccupancy` package to fit spatial occupancy models. `spOccupancy`
can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages('spOccupancy')`. Note we will be using some recent functionality incorporated into `spOccupancy`, so please re-install `spOccupancy` if you have installed it prior to November 1, 2023. 

### Installing additional R packages

In the exercises, we will use additional R packages for exploratory data analysis and visualizations. To fully participate in the exercises, we encourage you to install the packages below if you do not have them. The code below can be run in R to only install those packages that don't currently exist on your system.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
required.packages <- c('coda', 'MCMCvis', 'ggplot2', 'pals', 'sf', 'maps', 'stars')
new.packages <- required.packages[!(required.packages %in% installed.packages()[, 'Package'])]
if (length(new.packages) > 0) {
  install.packages(new.packages)
}
```

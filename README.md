+ [lecture-slides.pdf](./lecture-slides.pdf) contains the complete set of lecture slides. 
+ [exercises/exercise-1](./exercises/exercise-1) contains all data and R code for Exercise 1, which displays single-species spatial and nonspatial occupancy models by exploring amphibian occupancy in the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
+ [exercises/exercise-2](./exercises/exercise-2) contains all data and R code for Exercise 2, which displays multi-species spatial and nonspatial occupancy models using data from 10 songbird species in Switzerland.
+ [exercises/exercise-3](./exercises/exercise-3) contains all data and R code for Exercise 3, which shows how to fit multi-season spatial and nonspatial occupancy models in `spOccupancy` using data on the Wood Thrush from 2000-2009 across the eastern US.
